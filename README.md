# JAVA-Experiment

Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
It is easy to learn and simple to use.
It is open-source and free.
It is secure, fast and powerful.
It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers).
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.

## Uses
- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection and much more!

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If you don't have JDK installed, you can download it from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Development Kit Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have JDK installed and configured on your system.
2. Download the file you like from this repository.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile the Java file.
```
javac File_Name.java
```
6. Once the compilation is successful, run the program.
```
java File_Name
```
8. The program will execute and display the calculated results in the console.

### HelloWorld.java File

This file shows a simple program that prints Hello World.

**What is done in the program?**
- We created a class `HelloWorld`

Syntax:
```
class HelloWorld {
//body of the class
}
```

- This class contains a main function `public static void main()`

Syntax:
```
public static void main(String args[]) {
//body of the main function
}
```

- This main function is the function from where our program starts its execution. This main function contains a predefined function `System.out.println()` which is used to print/display the output the screen.

Syntax:
```
System.out.println("");
```

### Mathematical_Calculations.java File

This Java program performs basic mathematical calculations using two variables, `A` and `B`. The calculations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are printed to the console.

#### Output

The program will output the following mathematical calculations:

- The sum of `A` and `B`
- The difference of `A` and `B`
- The product of `A` and `B`
- The quotient of `A` and `B`

The output will be displayed in the console window.

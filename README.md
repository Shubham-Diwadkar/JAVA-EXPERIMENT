### HelloWorld.java File

This file shows a simple program that prints Hello World.

**What is done in the program?**
- We created a class `HelloWorld`

Syntax:
```
class HelloWorld {
//body of the class
}
```

- This class contains a main function `public static void main()`

Syntax:
```
public static void main(String args[]) {
//body of the main function
}
```

- This main function is the function from where our program starts its execution. This main function contains a predefined function `System.out.println()` which is used to print/display the output the screen.
